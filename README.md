# My Portfolio

I deployed a Heroku app to directly link my portfolio. Since Heroku doesn't support straight HTML, JavaScript, and CSS files, I was able to trick Heroku into thinking it was a PHP file (which Heroku supports). I added a compsoer.json and index.php file with minimal code.

### Explained

1. I took the "About Me" section from the Bootstrap homework and reformatted my index.html.

2. At the bottom of the page the user can click on any one of the links to deploy the desired app.
