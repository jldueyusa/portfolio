# My Portfolio

I deployed a Heroku app to directly link my portfolio. Since Heroku doesn't support straight HTML, JavaScript, and CSS files, I was able to trick Heroku into thinking it was a PHP file (which Heroku supports). I added a compsoer.json and index.php file with minimal code.

### Explained

1. I took the "About Me" section from the Bootstrap homework and added it to the top of my portfolio.html. I bolded text at the bottom to remind the user to scroll down to see my project links.

2. The user can click on any one of the links to click into the app.
